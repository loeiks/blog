# enesb.im blog

Th dream goal for this blog is to host every technology in house, from framework to database everything self-built and self-hosted. But this will take probably few years to build, main reason I want to achieve that is totally about having fun and learning a lot of stuff.

But another important goal of this blog/website is to let me keep publishing content whenever I want, so I want to ship quickly but while writing posts etc. also build these in house technologies.

For the first basic version, v0.1 I will use the following stack;

- Astro
- Cloudflare Workers
- Tailwind CSS
- Markdown (MDX)
- React

Nothing fancy or very extra, simple homepage and post pages that's it. In the future I also plan to publish different type of "mini apps" within my personal blog one idea I have is Valorant <-> CS2 crosshair converter at the path of `/app/crosshair-converter`.

History of this repo will show the evaluation of this blog.
