# My Blog

This is my personal website/blog (mostly blog) where I share some custom mini apps, posts etc. My dream goal for this blog is to build everything that powers it, shortly almost %100 in-house blog from framework used to database technology, I said almost %100 because I won't build a programming language nor hardware xd.

But I will go there slowly, because one of the other main goals for this blog is to "publish things" actually. This is also a playground and a learning place for me where I can play with things I learned.

## Tech Stack

For the current version you are looking at I used;

- Astro
- MDX (with Astro Content)
- Tailwind CSS
- Cloudflare Pages
- Bun (for package management)

that's it.
