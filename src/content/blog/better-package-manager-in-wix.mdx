If you ever used, or actively using Wix CLI for your Wix websites (not headless) you know there is a CLI command `wix install` and `wix uninstall` to install and remove `npm` packages.

The worst part of this command is that it’s not possible to install or uninstall multiple packages at once. Which is actually supported by `npm`. For example;

❌ This one doesn’t work;

```bash
wix install axios lodash @wix/stores
```

✅ Instead we have to do this way;

```bash
wix install axios
wix install lodash
wix install @wix/stores
```

And for some reason installs takes longer than classic `npm install` commands probably due to something extra changes in Wix based config files, or maybe something else I don’t know. 🤷‍♂️

> There is no way to fix this speed since `wix install` is required to apply changes to live site.

## Say hi to wixn

I built an npm package to fix this and make things a bit easier for devs.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/wixn

`wixn` allows you to install and uninstall packages with alias as well as install/uninstall multiple packages with single command.

✅ Example for install;

```bash
npx wixn i axios lodash @wix/stores
```

You can use **i, install or add** aliases for installing packages followed by the packages names.

✅ Example for uninstall;

```bash
npx wixn rm axios lodash
```

You can use **rm, remove, uninstall** aliases for uninstalling packages followed by the packages names.

✅ Example with --nx flag;

```bash
npx wixn i axios lodash @wix/stores --nx
```

This will skip the `wix install` part, to make packages available in the editor quickly.

## How it works?

`wixn` runs install or uninstall commands in parallel and while doing the job it shows you which packages are installed or uninstalled.

To make it faster you can use the `--nx` flag this will skip `wix install` part at the end which is enabled by default to apply changes to Wix after installing packages.

When you want to preview things or deploy changes run classic `wix install` to install all packages in `package.json` file this will handle everything needed on Wix side, otherwise running `npm install` only won’t install packages into site.
